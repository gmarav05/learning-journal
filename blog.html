            <h1>My new journey as a bootcamp student.</h1>
            <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big
                jump over to the Bootcamp to get <br> expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet
                like-minded peers.

            <h2>How I stay committed to learning</h2>
    
            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using <br>
                what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
            </p>
            <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.</p>
            
            <h2>How I got started</h2>
    
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning <br>
                session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own<br>
                words.
            </p>
    
            <p>That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and<br> 
                stay motivated.
            </p>
